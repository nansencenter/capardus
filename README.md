#  Capacity-building in Arctic Standardisation Development (CAPARDUS)
A Coordination and Support Action under H2020-LC-CLA-07-2019. Start date: 01 December 2019  End date: 31 May 2023
_Coordinator: Stein Sandven, Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center_

## Objectives
1. Establish a comprehensive framework for development, understanding and implementation of Arctic standards related to climate, environment and sustainable development;
2. Identify and document common practices as basis for development of standardization, building on the Ocean Best Practice System (www.oceanbestpractices.org); and
3. Engage communities active in the Arctic including research and services, Indigenous and local communities, commercial operators and governance bodies in defining Arctic Practice System

## Abstract
CAPARDUS is a CSA project under H2020 with focus on capacity-building to develop guidelines, standards and best practices related to exploitation of new technologies and utilization of data to support sustainable development in the Arctic. The capacity-building involve scientists, students, technology providers, economic actors, local communities, regulators and their organisations, who will participate in a series of workshops and research schools from 2020 to 2022. These events will be used as part of case studies in local communities in different regions, showing how the social-environmental systems are changing Arctic communities and what are the drivers for these changes. The climate change and its consequences in the Arctic leads to new requirements for planning and decision-making based on scientific and economic data, assessments and predictions. A prerequisite for good planning is access to data and information of relevance to the operators in the Arctic. The project will develop data management standards and best practices as a collaborative effort between scientists, local communities and other stakeholder groups, including economic actors who are interested in business development. Towards the end of the project CAPARDUS will provide recommendations for sustainable economic development in the Arctic, to the benefit of both local communities and other operators.

## Visualizing Arctic Standards Graph

There are many tools that can be used to access the Arctic Standards Graph that is included in this repository as an RDF model serialized using the Terse RDF Triple Format (Turtle) serialization (https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/).  The Graph was developed using the Progégé Ontology Editor (https://protege.stanford.edu/) and several extensions to Progégé can be used to visualize the graph including OntoGraph, OWLViz and VOWL.  The WebVOWL tool (http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl.html) can also be used for visualizing the graph.  See https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/ for the online version: Select "Ontology" -> Select Ontology File and then upload the Arctic Standards Graph in this repository to visualize.
